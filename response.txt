### **Week 1: Core Functionality**

This week is all about laying the groundwork for your file-sharing system. By the end of the week, you should have a basic, functioning command-line application that can connect to other peers and share files.

**Day 1-2: Project Setup and Peer Discovery**

* **Goal:** Initialize the project and enable peers to find each other on the network.
* **Features:**
    * Set up a new Go module for your project.
    * Integrate the `libp2p` library.
    * Implement a basic peer discovery mechanism using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). This will allow peers to announce their presence and find others.
    * Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) to start a peer and see discovered peers.

**Day 3-4: File Indexing and Searching**

* **Goal:** Allow peers to index their local files and search for files on the network.
* **Features:**
    * Create a mechanism for a peer to scan a designated directory and create an index of shareable files. This could be a simple in-memory map for now.
    * Implement a way for a peer to broadcast a search query to the network.
    * Peers that have a matching file should respond to the search query.
    * Update the CLI to allow users to add a directory to share and search for files by name.

**Day 5-7: Basic File Transfer**

* **Goal:** Implement the ability to download a file from another peer.
* **Features:**
    * When a search result is selected, establish a direct connection to the peer that has the file.
    * Implement the logic to transfer the file data from the provider to the requester.
    * Update the CLI to allow a user to select a file from the search results and download it.
    * Add basic progress indicators for the download.

### **Week 2: Advanced Features and Refinements**

Now that the core functionality is in place, this week focuses on making your file-sharing system more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

**Day 8-9: Multi-Peer Downloads**

* **Goal:** Speed up downloads by fetching file chunks from multiple peers simultaneously.
* **Features:**
    * Modify the file indexing to include file hashes and chunk information.
    * When a file is requested, find all peers that have the file.
    * Implement a strategy to download different chunks of the file from different peers in parallel.
    * Assemble the chunks in the correct order to reconstruct the file.

**Day 10-11: Security and Encryption**

* **Goal:** Secure the communication between peers and ensure data integrity.
* **Features:**
    * Integrate `libp2p`'s built-in support for encrypted communication channels (e.g., using TLS or Noise).
    * Ensure that all communication between peers is encrypted by default.
    * Use cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of file chunks and the complete file after download.

**Day 12-14: User Interface and Experience**

* **Goal:** Improve the usability of the application.
* **Features:**
    * Enhance the command-line interface with better formatting, colors, and more intuitive commands.
    * Implement features like resumable downloads. If a download is interrupted, it should be able to continue from where it left off.
    * Add a configuration file for users to specify settings like their shared directory and network ports.
    * Write a comprehensive README with instructions on how to build, configure, and use go-peerfs.

This plan provides a solid roadmap for building your p2p file-sharing system. Good luck with your project! ðŸš€
